Small collection of retro games (Pacman, Snake, BattleShip, etc.) implemented with VASmalltalk. Excellent examples for showing what you can do and for learning GUI development. Watch out [some screenshots](assets/screenshots/) to get an idea!

## Installation

1. Install [VA Smalltalk 9.2.1 or newer](https://www.instantiations.com/products/vasmalltalk/download.html).
2. Install Tonel support in your development image following [this guide](https://github.com/vasmalltalk/tonel-vast#installation).
3. Clone this repository.
4. The easiest and recommended approach is to install it via a script:

```smalltalk
| loader path |
path := (CfsPath named: '<insert path to root retro-games-vast local repo here>').
loader := TonelLoader readFromPath: path.
loader
	beUnattended. "do not prompt and use all defaults"
	useGitVersion.
loader loadAllMapsWithRequiredMaps.
```

However, for a more fine-tuned or advanced installation, you can load the Configuration Map `Retro Games` from the context menu of the Configuration Maps Browser: `"Import"` -> `"Load Configuration Maps from Tonel repository..."` -> select path to root `retro-games-vast` local repo. This will open a dialog that allows you to customize many aspects of the Tonel load. Refer to [its documentation](https://github.com/instantiations/tonel-vast#using-gui-menus) for more details.
